# advent-of-code-2021-kotlin

This repository uses the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

By intent, the code is not particularly robust or efficient.
My goal was to try unfamiliar language constructs and try to make it re-usable.

To run the code:
```
./gradlew wrapper
./gradlew build
# Replace XX by the day e.g. ./gradlew run -PexecMainClass=Day02Kt
./gradlew run -PexecMainClass=Day<XX>Kt
```
